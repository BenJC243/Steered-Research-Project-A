# Steered-Research-Project-A

For the Seurat analysis you will have to download all the files in the data folder and then run the R script I uploaded. To make sure the script runs smoothly you will have to change the "setwd()" command to the specific directory the files you previously downloaded. Make sure to remove the comments from these 3 lines in the script to download the necessary packages. 

#install.packages("devtools")

#devtools::install_github("VCCRI/CIDR")

#install CIDR from https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR

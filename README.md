# Steered-Research-Project-A

This project is for partial fulfilment of MSc Bioinformatics at the University of Leicester. Group A consists of: Solomon, Megan, Ben, Rawan and Karthik. All work submitted here is our own.

For the Seurat analysis you will have to download all the files in the data folder and then run the R script I uploaded. To make sure the script runs smoothly you will have to change the "setwd()" command to the specific directory the files you previously downloaded. 

Ensure that these packages are installed before running the seurat analysis script: 
#install.packages("devtools")

#devtools::install_github("VCCRI/CIDR")

#install CIDR from https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR

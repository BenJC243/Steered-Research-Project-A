<center>
Darmanis et al (2015) aimed to provide a map of the human brain transcriptome via the use of bioinformatics analysis. This project aimed to create a replicate analysis of this data, in order to determine whether the conclusions drawn by Darmanis et al (2015) could be replicated and whether the use of an alternative pipeline would alter any results. 

Our reanalysis of the Darmanis et (2015) data leads to the identification of a similar number of clusters, representing similar cell types. However, our initial reanalysis identified 9 key clusters, compared to 10 clusters from Darmanis et al (2015). After using an alternative pipeline including, the use of Seurat we identified 7 clusters. In both analyses, we did not identify the same gene clusters as identified by Darmanis et al (2015), indicating that the parameters and reference genome chosen were not the same as what was used in the initial analysis.

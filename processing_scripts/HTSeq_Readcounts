# HTSeq installation
conda install htseq

# note: may have to generate new environment variable before installing HTSeq, see:

# Count matrix v2 --> generate one count matrix per SAM file:
for i in /scratch/spectre/b/bc234/STAR/STAR-2.7.10a/SAMS/*.sam; do
        python -m HTSeq.scripts.count $i /scratch/spectre/b/bc234/STAR/STAR-2.7.10a/hg19_gtf/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf --additional-attr=gene_name -m intersection-nonempty -s no > "$i"COUNTS.csv
done

  # Merge files:
# generate new files of first 2 cols cut from each matrix (leaving only their counts as 1 col)
for i in /home/bc234/zip_test/csvs/*.csv; do
        cut -f3- $i > "$i"cut
done

# append cut matrices to 1st sample containing its gene names (SRR1974543)
paste /home/bc234/zip_test/csvs/4543/SRR1974543.csv \
/home/bc234/zip_test/csvs/*cut >> new.csv

# remove 1st col (Ensembl gene IDs), leaving csv file w/ gene names in 1st col, read counts of each sample in remaining cols:
cut -f2- new.csv > new_final.csv

# remove last 5 rows (num of unmapped reads)
head -n -5 new_final.csv > new_final.csv
